### Purpose/motivation
The purpose of this project is to provide data visualization about Proposition 23, which would invoke new rules for Dialysis Clinics. This GitHub repository contains code for team Dialysis Analysis for the [2020 CA Data Challenge](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/ca-election-2020-data-challenge/) sponsored by [UC Davis DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/) and the [Scholars Strategy Network](https://scholars.org/chapter/sacramento). Our goal is to provide data visualizations that will allow voters to make an informed decision about Proposition 23 during the 2020 California election.

## About Dialysis and Clinics

Dialysis is a medical procedure where a patient's blood is taken out of their body, cleaned, and put back for patients that are experiencing kidney failture. Patients must receive dialysis three times a week for 3-4 sessions until they receive a new kidney or for the rest of their lives. As of 2020, **roughly 80,000 individuals in CA depend on dialysis** to survive. Out of the **600 dialysis clinics** in California, **75%** are owned by the private, for-profit companies [DaVita, Inc.](https://www.davita.com/) and [Fresenius Medical Care](https://fmcna.com/).

## Tenents of Prop 23

**1. Require a Licensed Physician, Physicianâ€™s Assistant, or Nurse Practitioner to be on site at clinics during operating hours.**

Currently, dialysis clinics are staffed with Patient Care Technicians and a Medical Director. Prop 23 would require a Physician, Physician's Assistant, or Nurse Practitioner to be on site at all times that patients are being treated.

**2. Require clinics to report infections to the state.**

Dialysis clinics currently report infection data to the federal government. Proponents of Prop 23 say that this would make it easier for patients to find this information, and because this information is already collected, it would not be difficult to also report it to the state. Opponents of Prop 23 say that it is unnecessary to report this information because it is already given to the federal government.

**3. Require clinics to get approval before closing.**

Although hospitals are required to get approval before closing, dialysis clinics do not. Proponents of this bill say that this requirement will prevent For-Profit clinics from closing clinics that are in remote locations or not profitable, insuring that patients do not lose access to clinics.

**4. Prohibits clinics from discrimination against patients based on public or private insurance.**

Prop 23 would prevent dialysis clinics from treating patients different based on their insurance type.
